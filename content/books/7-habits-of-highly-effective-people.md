# Habit #1: Be Proactive

- Be proactive
- Take responsibility
- Given the stimulus/environment/conditioning, you have the freedom to choose your response.
- Use the _inside-out_ approach rather trying to force an _outside-in_ growth.
- Grow your _Cicle Of Influence_ rather than focussing on _Circle of Concern_.
- 3 types of problems
- Value based response rather than feeling/instinctive based response
