# Foreword
-----------------
- A real gentleman never discusses women he's broken up with or how much tax he's paid.
- No matter how mundane some action might appear, keep at it long enough and it becomes a contemplative, even meditative act.
- Mantra: *Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.*
- This book contains a certain amount of personal life lessons learned by Murakami over his life.

# Who's Going to Laugh at Mick Jagger?
------------------
- Let the exhilaration you feel at the end of each activity carry you to the next day. 
- The important thing for long-term projects is to *keep up the rhythm*. 
Once you set the pace, rest will follow. The problem is getting the flywheel to 
spin at a set speed - and to get to that point takes as much concentration and 
effort as you can manage.
- Clouds and the sun metaphor! ❤️
- The accumulation of commonplace and unpretentious memories has led to one result - me, in this moment.
- "Sometimes when I think of life, I feel like a piece of driftwood washed up on shore."
- The older you get, the busier you become.
- Uncomfortable with competitive sports
    - More interested in whether I reach the goals that I set for myself.
    - There is nothing like failing or succeeding beyond the measure you have for yourself.
    - You can't fool yourself.
    - The point should rather be whether or not I improved over yesterday.
    - The only opponent you have to beat is yourself, the way you used to be.
- At a certain age, everybody reaches their physical peak.
- *Runner's blues*
- Rivers always look about the same.
- Murakami is the kind of person who doesn't find it painful to be alone.
- During his twenties, Murakami's worldview changed and he matured.
    - Acquired the practical skills needed to live by sticking his nose into all sorts of places.
- I just run. I run in a void. I run in order to acquire a void.
- The thoughts that occur to me while I'm running are like clouds in the sky.
- Mick Jagger: "I'd rather be dead than still singing 'Satisfaction' when I'm forty-five."
    - Nobody remembers what stupid things I might have said back then, so they're 
    not about to quote them back at me.
- It's a first-time experience for everybody to grow old, so put off your judgements and criticism and accept things as they are.
- It's ceratinly not fun to be misunderstood or criticised, but rather a painful experience that hurts people deeply.
    - This pain is a necessary part of life.
- It's precisely because people are different from others that they're able to create their own independent selves.
- **Emotional hurt is the price a person has to pay in order to be independent.**
- The sense of isolation is a double-edged sword.
- *Direct all your frustations towards improving yourself.*
- **Being disliked by someone, hated and despised, somehow seems more natural.**
